# Overview
This repository explores Webflix, a fictional streaming platform, to optimize the homepage and minimize user browsing time. Webflix users often face decision paralysis due to choice overload, leading to frustration and disengagement. This project conducts A/B tests on the “Today’s Top Picks for You” row to identify strategies that help users decide faster and improve their experience.

The experiments focus on four factors:

1. Tile Size: How many tiles are visible based on their height-to-screen ratio..
2. Match Score: Predicted enjoyment percentage for each show/movie.
3. Preview Length: Duration (in seconds) of autoplay previews.
4. Preview Type: The format of the preview (Teaser/Trailer or Actual Content) shown when hovering over a tile.
   
By analyzing the impact of these variables, this project offers insights into reducing browsing time and enhancing user engagement.
